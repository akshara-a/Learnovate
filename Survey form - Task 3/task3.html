    <h2> Our role in upliftment of Textile industry </h2>
    <p class="paragraphOne"> A great man once said “Healthy discontent is the prelude to progress”. NAF as an organization wants to bridge the gap between the capability and the reality of Indian textile industry. Now, the question is how? Basically we’re going by an approach of the same great man who once said “A nation’s culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people”. India is a country known for its splendid textile designs, availability of raw materials and at most the people who’ve inherited the art of weaving from their forefathers. People who were once the flag bearers of “the skilled” in India are now living in the lap of poverty!! Our weavers and handloom artisans even after having skill and passion towards their work are unable to earn two meals a day. We’re going to promote the idea of using handloom textile through various social media platforms, raise donations to provide the start-up capital to the weavers and artisans and basically create a space where artisans don’t have to forget their set of skills just because people have forgotten them. </p>
